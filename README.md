# Simple Solidity Smart Contract and Frontend Interaction

This project demonstrates how to create a simple Solidity smart contract 
with three functions and interact with it using a frontend application. 
The frontend uses `ethers.js` to communicate with the smart contract deployed
on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

## Smart Contract

The Solidity smart contract `SimpleContract` includes the following functions:
- `getValue()`: Returns the current value stored in the contract.
- `setValue(uint256 newValue)`: Sets the value stored in the contract to `newValue`.
- `doubleValue()`: Doubles the current value stored in the contract.
